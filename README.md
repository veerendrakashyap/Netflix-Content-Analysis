# Netflix Content Analysis: An Exploratory Data Approach

## Project Type
EDA / Univariate & Bivariate Analysis


## About the Project

In today’s digital-first entertainment landscape, Netflix has emerged as a global leader in the video streaming space. This project explores the Netflix dataset to derive insights about the types of content available, patterns over the years, top contributing countries, directors, and other interesting statistics.

The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and useful business insights using visual storytelling and Python-based analysis.

## Problem Statement

Analyze Netflix’s dataset to answer the following questions:
- What type of content is more available on Netflix — Movies or TV Shows?
- Which year had the most content added?
- What are the top 10 genres on Netflix?
- Which country produces the most content?
- Who are the top directors and actors featured?
- What is the average duration of content?

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), consisting of:
- Show ID
- Type (Movie/TV Show)
- Title
- Director and Cast
- Country
- Date Added and Release Year
- Rating and Duration
- Genre (listed_in)
- Description

## Key Insights

- Movies dominate the platform compared to TV Shows.
- The highest number of content additions happened in 2019.
- United States contributes the most content.
- Most content on Netflix falls under 'Dramas' and 'International Movies'.
- Top-rated shows and movies were clustered between 2015 to 2020.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook: `Netflix_EDA_Veerendra_Kashyap.ipynb`.
3. Make sure required libraries are installed: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can help uncover insights from a large streaming platform’s catalog. With such analysis, Netflix and similar platforms can enhance recommendations, understand audience preferences, and plan content acquisition more strategically.
